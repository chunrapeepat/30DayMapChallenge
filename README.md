# 30DayMapChallenge

A collection (and a full documentation) of my experimentation with maps in 2025. [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge)

## The Big Picture

**Motivation:** everyone uses maps. when we travel, when we learn history, when we read fiction, but few actually make them. my goal for this challenge is to learn how to make my own maps to support these activities i'm interested.

**Rules:**
- document everything, here.
- stay flexible with the plan.
- work on it when time allows, no need for 30 consecutive days

**The Big Plan:**
- day 1-2: build maps using basic shapes.
- day 3-9: build interactive maps, visualize data.
- day 10-16: experiment with physical maps.
- day 17-23: experiment with aesthetic, 3d maps.
- day 24-30: i don't know that yet, let's find out later.
