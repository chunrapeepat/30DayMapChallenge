# 30DayMapChallenge

A collection (and a full documentation) of my experimentation with maps in 2025. [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge)

## The Big Picture

**Motivation:** everyone uses maps. when we [travel](https://www.instagram.com/chunrapeepat/), when we [learn history](https://x.com/chunrapeepat/status/1735255332304441682), when we [read fiction/non-fiction books](https://chunrapeepat.com/books/), but few actually make them. my goal for this challenge is to learn how to make my own maps to support these activities i'm interested.

**Rules:**

- document everything, here.
- stay flexible with the plan.
- work on it when time allows, no need for 30 consecutive days

**The Big Plan:**

- day 1-2: build maps using basic shapes.
- day 3-9: build interactive maps, visualize data.
- day 10-16: experiment with physical maps.
- day 17-23: experiment with aesthetic, 3d maps.
- day 24-30: i don't know that yet, let's find out later.

**Inspiration/People to Follow:**

- **[Topi Tjukanov](https://x.com/Tjukanov):** the original creator of the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge).
- **[Wendy Shijia](https://x.com/ShijiaWendy):** inspiration for aesthetic and physical map experiments.
